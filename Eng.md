# 1. Website establishment statement

> The purpose of this site is to collect scientific online information as comprehensively as possible, and organize it for communication. Before using this site, make sure that you are familiar with the relevant laws of the country where you are located, and be able to understand the legal nature of your actions and be responsible for your actions. It is strictly forbidden to use the information provided by this site to engage in illegal activities or obtain other illegitimate interests. If you cannot comply with these regulations, please do not use the services provided by this site. Violating relevant regulations and using the information services of this site to cause damage to the country, society and others has nothing to do with this site and its creators. Users and viewers are requested to study the relevant laws and regulations carefully, and be good citizens who abide by the laws and regulations!

Users please make sure that you have learned the network security knowledge about the causes and working principles of the Great Firewall, criminal law network security crimes, administrative regulations on accessing foreign websites and self-built international Internet channels. If you are not familiar with the above concepts or cannot clearly prohibit the use of the content provided by this site, if you obtain services similar to this site or can achieve the same purpose from other channels, this site has nothing to do with it.<br>

ü§£This project is just for fun, if you see it, please raise your hand and correct me for my misconduct. Friends, if you find it useful and fun, you can play it in private, don't take it seriously, and don't spread it.

# 2. Site building process
1‚É£Ô∏èThis project is written by myself in addition to the Jekyll template used. Although the actual principle is very simple, it still has a sense of accomplishment. This film description is also the first time I write README<br>
2‚É£Ô∏èThis site is based on Jekyll's [Cayman](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman) theme, changing relative links to absolute links; Customization is not suitable for other people to use their own ```jekyll theme```, if you want to use it, please use the original version. <br>

> Tool modification content and modification method: [see here for details](https://github.com/wchenyi/cayman#readme)

Here I would like to express my sincere admiration and thanks to the original creators. If there are any rights in this document or other people violate the regulations, please contact me, and I will delete it immediately and stop it.

# 3. Site content
1‚É£Ô∏è This site is not just a simple download site, there are also a lot of explanatory documents and related information recommendations inside. The content will be updated from time to time, but it cannot be guaranteed to be the latest, nor can it be guaranteed to be accurate and effective; if you mind this, please use it with caution.<br>
2‚É£Ô∏èThe content of the explanatory document on this site comes from some of my own thoughts and the video content of YouTube bloggers Dianwan Technology AK and Bad Lin, and I have organized it myself. If there is any infringement, please contact me to delete it. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to you guys!<br>
3‚É£Ô∏èThis site was originally only for your own needs. After collecting the official website addresses of various tools on the Internet, it was sorted out in a more comfortable form. After there is more content later, it will be organized into a dedicated site, and the interface and content layout will be continuously optimized for a better look and feel. The site provides services including but not limited to:<br>

- Tools download channels for Hongmeng, Android, Windows, Mac, IOS, iPad OS, LInux* and other platforms.
- Description of some software sources (without specific usage methods)
- Explanation of the concept and principle of scientific online
- Conversion tools, streaming ride-sharing platforms, Google tools
- Personal experience, evaluation, etc.
