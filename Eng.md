# 2. Site building process
1‚É£Ô∏èThis project was developed by myself with my own knowledge except for the Jekyll template used. Although the implementation principle is very simple, it still has a sense of accomplishment. This film description is also the first time I write README<br>
2‚É£Ô∏èBased on Jekyll's Cayman theme, this site has deeply customized the theme of this site, and the theme of this site is deeply bound to the content of this site. It is not suitable for others to use as their own jekyll theme, please use the original version if you want to use it. Here is the modified part, but please note that I am not a system-trained developer, so the professional vocabulary and content may not be accurate or completely wrong, please bear with me. <br>
3‚É£Ô∏èWhat is written here is a personalized modification of the original theme [Cayman](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman), and I deleted the original [README](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman#readme) for ease of modification. Rewrote the changes you need, if you want to view the original document, please go to the original repository. This topic is only for my project [Wall](https://wangct.tk/wall) to do in-depth customization, so it is not suitable for others to use directly, if you are interested in the modification mode and finished effect of this site, you can modify the page theme you want according to the basis and method provided by this site. <br>
